            Hi! My name is Jacob, and I'm currently a 3rd-year BSc. student at UBC, specializing in CPSC. I enjoy working on various projects and learning more about cool technologies available in CS! In my spare time, I enjoy watching travel videos, indoor bouldering, and juggling! You can reach me at foo@bar.com.

            This project is my submission for Assignment 1 of CPSC 455, which is a simple website built using Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. As per requirements, every page has a navbar, and loads CSS and JS from external files. Additionally, the site is built to be responsive through the use of &ltmeta&gt tags and media queries, as well as flex containers for displaying team member cards. Additionally, there is a JSON string used initialize the starting team members, as well as list used to store team members (shared across pages using <emph>sessionStorage</emph>). One interesting thing I tried to implement was the dynamic setting of a card's background colour, based on the average colour of the corresponding member's photo!
